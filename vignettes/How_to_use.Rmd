  With *scdoc*, you can combine several powerful tools to write a long scientific 
  document directly within *R Studio* using *markdown*. Compared to the native support
  of *R markdown* in *R Studio*, *scdoc* adds:
  
  - automatic numbering of titles, tables and figures;
  - automatically generated list of contents, list of tables and list of figures;
  - add automatically the appropriate number to internal links to a title, a table or a figure;
  - smart punctuation;
  - production of an HTML version with a modern design, an easy navigation and 
  footnotes presented as side-notes;
  - production of a PDF version with a classic design and page numbers added 
  to internal links.

# About *scdoc*

*scdoc* is developed by Joseph Larmarange on GitHub<i class="icon-github-circled"></i>:<br />
<https://github.com/larmarange/scdoc>

For questions, bugs or feature requests:<br />
<https://github.com/larmarange/scdoc/issues>

# Pre-requisite

To works properly, *scdoc* needs that several tools are installed on your computer.

## R Studio

First, *scdoc* is principally designed to be used with the *R Studio*, an
integrated development environment (IDE) for *R*. *R Studio* is available
for Windows, Mac OS and Linux on <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/>.

## pandoc

*scdoc* uses *pandoc* to convert a *markdown* file to *HTML*. 
*pandoc* could be downloaded on <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html>.
*pandoc* needs to be accessible as command-line tool^[On Windows, you will probably have
to add manually the path to *pandoc* to the system `path` variable.
To test if *pandoc* is available as command-line, open a *command prompt* and 
type `pandoc --help`. If you get an error (command not recognized), search for
the directory where is located the file `pandoc.exe` (something like 
`C:\Users\mon_nom\AppData\Local\Pandoc\`). Add this directory to the Windows
system `path` (see <http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm>).]. 
NB: due to changes in *pandoc*, please use a recent version (≥ 1.12).

## Prince XML

*Prince XML* is used to generate the PDF version of your document
^[Generating a PDF is optional, see [section](#params).].
It could be downloaded from <http://www.princexml.com/download/>. 
*Prince XML* should also be available as a command-line tool^[On Windows, the directory
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Prince\Engine\bin` should be added to the system `path`.].

## zotxt

You can insert *Zotero* references within your R markdown file. For that, you will
need to install *zotxt* and *pandoc-zotxt*:

- Install the Firefox add-on *zotxt* (<https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/zotxt/>)
- *Python* should be available on your computer (to install it, cf. <http://www.python.org/download/>)
- Install *pip* <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>
- Type and execute the command `pip install pandoc-zotxt` (in a prompt window or 
  with the function  `system` within R)

# Installing scdoc

In *R*, execute the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)){
    install.packages('devtools')
    library(devtools)
}
install_github("scdoc","larmarange")
```


# Utilisation

When staring a new R session, execute the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
require(scdoc)
scdoc()
```

That's all! Edit your *R markdown* (`.Rmd`) in *R Studio*.
Click on  **Knit HTML** to produce the HTML^[The HTML file
is self-contained and can be easily shared.]
(and PDF if required) version of your document.

# Parameters of the document {#params}

Note: you can use this document as a model for your owns.

## YAML metadata bloc {#config_yaml}

Several options can be define at the beginning of your document in a 
[YAML](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) bloc. To be recognized by *scdoc*, this 
bloc^[See as an example
<https://github.com/larmarange/scdoc/blob/master/How_to_use.Rmd>.] must
start by a line containing only `---` and end by a line containing only `...`. 
All parameters are optional.


Table: Parameters of the YAML metadata bloc

------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------
lang          Lang of your document in ISO alpha 2 format,
              `'en'` for English, `'fr'` for French...

title         Title of your document

author        Author(s) (several entries allowed)

date          Date of your document (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, to generate
              automatically the date of the current day, indicate
              <code>'\`​r format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d")\`'</code>)

tags          Key-words

abstract      Abstract (should start by `|` for a abstract with several
              paragraphs, each paragraph being indented)

toc-title     Title for the table of contents

tof-title     Title for the table of figures

tot-title     Title for the table of tables

prefix-fig    Prefix for figures numbering (default: *Figure*)

prefix-table  Prefix for tables numbering (default: *Table*)

pdf           To generate a PDF version of your document with *Prince XML*, this
              option should be equal to `'prince'`
------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other parameters {#config_others}

It is recommended to add the following code at the beginning of your document:

~~~~~~
```{r configuration, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(
  comment = NA, # No ## put before source code output
  dev = "svg", # Plots in SVG (usually rendering better in PDF)
  cache = TRUE, # Cache
  fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6 # Default size for plots
)
options(
  knitr.table.format = "html", # Tables directly in HTML (kable)
  xtable.type = "html", # Tables in HTML (xtable)
  xtable.caption.placement = "top" # Caption at the top of tables (xtable)
)
knit_hooks$set(plot = hook_plot_html) # Figures directly in HTML
windowsFonts(sans=windowsFont("Open Sans")) # Default font for plots
```
~~~~~~

Options defined through `opts_chunk$set` are optional. You can adapt them according 
to your needs. For plots, we recommend SVG as the result is better when producing
a PDF file (SCG is also correctly interpreted by modern browsers).

`options(knitr.table.format = "html")` and `knit_hooks$set(plot = hook_plot_html)`
are required for providing adequately an identifier and a title to tables and figures
(see [section](#tables) and [section](#figures) for more details).
`xtable.type` and `xtable.caption.placement` are required only if you use
*xtable* package.

`windowsFonts(sans=windowsFont("Open Sans"))` is optional and allows you to specify
the default font used by R for plots.

# Markdown

As *scdoc* uses *pandoc* to generate an HTML file, you can use all markdown extensions
implemented in *pandoc*, see <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown>.
You can also write directly HTML code that will be preserved.

# Titles and internal links

Titles are automatically numbered. You can specify that a specific title should not
be numbered by adding the specific CSS class `.unnumbered`.

```
## Unnumbered title {.unnumbered}
```

will produce

## Unnumbered title {.unnumbered}

To create an internal link to a title, you need first to attribute an unique 
identifier to it:

```
## Title with an identifier {#id_title}
```

will produce

## Title with an identifier {#id_title}

Use this identifier to create an internal link.

```
See [section](#id_title).
```

will produce

> See [section](#id_title).

You can notice that the number of the title has been automatically added to the 
link (and the page number in the PDF version).

# Include R chunks

## Code bloc

~~~~~~~~~
```{r}
summary(cars)
```
~~~~~~~~~

will produce

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Another example:

~~~~~~~~~
```{r}
summary(cars)
str(cars)
sum(cars$speed)
```
~~~~~~~~~

```{r}
summary(cars)
str(cars)
sum(cars$speed)
```

For more details, see <http://yihui.name/knitr/>.

## Inline code

You can insert R code directly in a text with the following syntax:<br />
<code>\`r ... some R code ... \`</code>

~~~~~~~~~~
The sum of 3 plus 4 is equal to `r 3+4`.
~~~~~~~~~~

will produce

> The sum of 3 plus 4 is equal to `r 3+4`.

# Tables {#tables}

Tables are automatically numbered and a table of tables is automatically generated.
Prefix for tables numbers and the title of the list of tables are customizable
(see [chapter](#config_yaml)).

Several functions and R packages can produce correctly formatted tables in HTML.
For each package, we detail how to define an identifier and/or a caption.
An identifier is required to create an internal link, for example:

```
See [table](#example_kable).
```

will produce

> See [table](#example_kable).

## Function kable

You need a recent version of *knitr* (≥ 1.5.15) to be able to define a caption.
The last version of *knitr* can be installed with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
require(devtools)
install_github('knitr', 'yihui')
```

First, you need to calculate your table (with a function like `table` or
`xtabs`).

```{r}
data(Titanic)
d <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
tab <- xtabs(Freq~Class+Survived, data=d)
```

Then, you need to call the function `kable` in a chunk with the option
`results='asis'` in order that the HTML code produced by `kable` will be include as is.
It is also important to force *knitr* to generate tables in HTML
(`options(knitr.table.format = "html")`, see [section](#config_others)).

The `caption` argument (optional) allows to define a title for the table.
To add an identifier, you will use the `table.attr` argument. Finally,
you can specify text alignment for each column with `align`.

```{r, results='asis'}
kable(tab, table.attr = 'id="example_kable"', 
      caption = "Table generated with kable", 
      align = c('l','r','r'))
```


## xtable package

The *xtable* package can also generate HTML tables.
It is recommended to specify the options `xtable.type` and `xtable.caption.placement`
at the beginning of your document (see [section](#config_others)).

As for `kable`, `xtable` should be called in a chunk with the option
`results='asis'`. The syntax to generate a table is:

```{r, results='asis', message=FALSE}
require(xtable)
xtable(tab, caption="Table generated with xtable", 
       label="example_xtable", 
       align=c("lrr"))
```

## tables package

You need a recent version of *tables* (0.7.67 or more). The last version could
be installed with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tables", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

First, the table will be calculated with the function `tabular` (see 
`?tabular` for more details):

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(tables)
tab2 <- tabular( (Species + 1) ~ (n=1) + Format(digits=2)*
         (Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width)*(mean + sd), data=iris )
```

The table will be converted in HTML with the function `html`. This function 
needs to be called in a chunk with the option `results='asis'`. A specificity 
of *tables* is that the title need to be defined with the function `table_options` 
before calling `html`. It is recommended to reset this option to `NULL` just after
to avoid undesired title for the following tables.

```{r, results='asis'}
table_options(HTMLcaption = 'Tableau généré avec tabular et html') 
html(tab2, id='exemple_tabular')
table_options(HTMLcaption = NULL) 
```

# Plots {#figures}

According to HTML 5, the tag `<figure>` should be used to embed images or other 
medias. One figure can contain several plots. The title of a figure should be
defined with `<figcaption>`.

Figures are automatically numbered and a table of figures is automatically generated.
Prefix for figures numbers and the title of the list of figures are customizable
(see [chapter](#config_yaml)).

`<figure>` and `<figcaption>` will be directly written in the markdown file.
(NB: this approach will work only if the option 
`knit_hooks$set(plot = hook_plot_html)` has been defined at the beginning of 
your document, see [section](#config_others).)

~~~~~~~~~
<figure id="example_fig">
```{​r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
<figcaption>Figure title</figcaption>
</figure>
~~~~~~~~~

will produce

<figure id="example_fig">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
<figcaption>Figure title</figcaption>
</figure>

Adding an identifier is required if you want to create an internal link. For example:

```
See [figure](#example_fig).
```

will produce

> See [figure](#example_fig).

A plot created outside a `<figure>` tag will not be added to the table of figures.

~~~~~~~~~
```{​r, echo=FALSE}
plot(table(rpois(100, 5)), type = "h", col = "red", lwd = 10,
     main = "rpois(100, lambda = 5)")
```
~~~~~~~~~

will produce

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(table(rpois(100, 5)), type = "h", col = "red", lwd = 10,
     main = "rpois(100, lambda = 5)")
```

# Footnotes

```
This is a text^[with a footnote].
```

will produce

> This is a text^[with a footnote].

Several syntax can be used with *pandoc* to generate footnotes
(see <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#footnotes> for more details).

# Equations

You can write LaTeX equations.

```
$\alpha+\beta=\gamma$
$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
```

will produce

> $\alpha+\beta=\gamma$
> $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

Equations are transformed in MathML. If there is at least one equation in the document,
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) will be automatically loaded to display properly equations
with all browsers.

# Smart punctuation

Smart punctuation option of *pandoc*
^[<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#smart-punctuation>]
is used. *pandoc* will produce typographically correct output, 
converting straight quotes (`""`) to curly quotes (""), `---` to em-dashes (---),
`--` to en-dashes (--), and `...` to ellipses (...). Non-breaking spaces are inserted 
after certain abbreviations, such as “Mr.”.

~~~~~~
--  ---   ...  "test"
~~~~~~

will produce

> --  ---   ...  "test"
  
# Bibliographic references

You can add bibliographic references in your text. For example, *TraMineR* package
is useful to analyze sequences [@gabadinho:2011analyzing]. For more details, 
see <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#citations>.

You need to add your bibliography as a YAML bloc in your *R markdown* file.

It is also possible to use *zotxt* in order to automatically retrieve references
from your Zotero database. Simply add the option `- zotxt:'yes'` in your YAML metadata 
bloc at the beginning of your document (see [section](#config_yaml)). In this case,
Zotero should be running when you click on **Knit HTML**.

Another option is to use the function `zotxt2yaml` provided by *scdoc* to extract,
with *zotxt* the references cited in your document and to generate the YAML of
your bibliography before to copy and paste it in your document.
